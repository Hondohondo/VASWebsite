            <p class="margin-bottom-20">
                According to World Bank statistics, there is a 6.5% youth unemployment in Tanzania, while over 80% of the total working population are self-employed in informal sectors majority of which are youth. For example, majority of the youth in the creative industry in Tanzania fall under the informal/unproductive sectors, due to skills gap and lower entry barriers such as lower capital among other factors.
            </p>

            <p class="margin-bottom-20">
                The creative industry in Tanzania largely remains a sleeping giant, characterized by a rich pool of young potentials, who lack the infrastructure and capacity to monetize/commercialize talent in local, regional and global creative market economy.

                Studies by the WHO, UNCTAD and the Millennium Development Goals have all cited the potential the creative industries contribute to Africa’s economic growth, stating some of the key drivers of job creation including: art and crafts, design, music, film and television.
            </p>

            <p class="margin-bottom-20">
                Interviews and preliminary conversations with art directors and hundreds of local artists in Dar es Salaam indicated countless limitations for many art entrepreneurs in the creative industry; which largely influence the ability to commercialize talent in regional and international market. These insights critically help understand the results this fragmented industry molds; where majority of the creative youths’ work for daily fees rather than salaries and hustle as freelancers’ creatives instead of being represented by a creative agency.

                Visual Aided Stories envisions to increase market share and visibility of Africa’s creative art, culture and aesthetics in the creative economy. Contributing to this mission, requires VAS to collaborate with the wider ecosystem and establish professional relationship with art collectors, art museums and investment banking professionals across regions.
