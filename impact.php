                All programs and activities are designed to boost self-esteem and provide talented youth with alternatives to unemployment/involvement in informal sectors. Over the 2 years, talented youth in our database have been given access to public domains to showcase talent, get free advertising and extra revenue opportunities. Other talented youths gained recognition and value to create more jobs/tenders. Youth are also encouraged to explore variety of other extra-curricular activities in the hope that they will continue to pursue these activities after the completion of the program, whether they do so at VAS Hub or at their own.

                Artist Jordan, has transformed the ambiance at Bahari beach with a series of artworks hanging around the beach. His work caught the eye of Tanzania’s International artist, Harmonize and Uganda’s Spice Diana who utilized the area to shoot ‘Kokonya’ music video. Jordan received a small support fund from VAS and is now looking for local government license to open his beach art gallery to exploit this area, which is a weekend destination for many locals and tourists.

                Edward Tibasima and two other artists from VAS Hub joined hands and registered their art business “Colour Tanzania” to promote grass root training for artists. VAS helped Color Tanzania to identify revenue streams through vehicle marketing (including painting cars, Bajaj and motorcycles) and office branding. With a registered business entity Edward went on to pursue tenders with a health IT office named “Mobile Afya TZ”. Edward is now working to paint mural artworks in various tourist locations under the Office of the President.

            <p class="margin-bottom-20">
                The community and nearby region, benefit by being exposed to readily accessible art. Our street art program creates free public art that connect, educate and inspire communities. By selecting areas and fixing up walls to paint murals, we transform and revitalize the aesthetic value in those areas. Our team often facilitates preliminary conversation with communities to identify whatever that is unique or significant in that area that can be incorporated in the mural artworks. This information is then briefed to artists during the creative process. You can look at all different aspects of what art looks like in the community, but it is very strongly linked to the culture
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20">
                We believe with more support given to this form of art, the more a culture of arts, patriotism, and inspiration is built around its youth and society as a whole. This way the community becomes a more tangible asset. For example, Zingatia street art campaigns remain relevant in 2021 and shows the importance of engaging with the mass in development area and things that impact life and death. The campaign had significant impact in neighborhoods including Ilala, Temeke, Vingunguti, Mwananyamala, Tandale, Kinondoni and Kigogo.

                Studies by the WHO, UNCTAD and the Millennium Development Goals have all cited the potential the creative industries contribute to Africa’s economic growth, stating some of the key drivers of job creation including: art and crafts, design, music, film and television.

                Interviews and preliminary conversations with art directors and hundreds of local artists in Dar es Salaam indicated countless limitations for many art entrepreneurs in the creative industry; which largely influence the ability to commercialize talent in regional and international market. These insights critically help understand the results this fragmented industry molds; where majority of the creative youths’ work for daily fees rather than salaries and hustle as freelancers’ creatives instead of being represented by a creative agency.
